	This space might be used for getting information and staying updated on how we can build a low-cost ventilator during this crisis of COVID-19. This is an attempt to replicate an existing design and contribute to open-source projects. This page will be updated with all the latest information within the circuit.

<h2>Intro to Mechanical Ventilation</h2>
<p>
	This was written by <strong>Robert L. Read</strong>. Great starting point for people looking to contibute.

<h2>Low-Cost Open-Source Ventilator-ish Device</h2>
<p>
	Open Source project by <strong>Johnny Lee</strong> in attempt to build a low-cost ventilator. </p>

<blockquote>Probably best state of buildability at the the time of this writing. The link above is to the repo. The inventor, Johnny Lee, is actively improving the system as of March 21st, and has called for assistance. It has been pressure-tested. It has a <a href="https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>Please do take a look at the above implementation to get an idea on what we might be building and on what scale. Please do read it completely and thoroughly to get an overview. This should may be set a starting point in replicating the design or building one.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Johnny has prepared a list of <a href="https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator#to-dos-aka-things-i-could-use-help-with" target="_blank">ToDo's</a> that he needs help with, which are also included in the repo. </p><p>Now, after going through the implementation and the ToDo's, below you can find a form link where you can fill your thoughts in order to set a ball park in replicating the implementation. Please do share your thoughts on it, whether it is 'that it can be implemented' or 'maybe there will be some issues' or 'not possible', anything, would love to hear from you.</p><blockquote>Even if we are not able to replicate it, we might as well offer him our full assistance.</blockquote>

<h3>Feasibility Check</h3>

<p> Click <a href="https://forms.gle/2hjThmcXbfJko4SN7" target="_blank">here</a> to fill a form to check feasibility to implement the solution</p>

<p> I'll prepare a notes with the responses as we receive them for tracking progress</p>

<p>If you feel, you know someone that can actually help with this, please do share with them. If you find any useful information, in relevance to this project, please do <a href="mailto:adityagannavarapu.67@gmail.com" target="_top">mail</a> me the links, I'll update this space.</p>
