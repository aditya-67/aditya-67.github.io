<h2>MST'16: A New Chapter</h2>
<p>
Sports are an integral part of character development and decidedly imperative to make all rounded, socially aware and responsible engineers. Following its motto, “कर्मसुकौशलम” (Excellence in Action), MNIT conducted its first sports event MST (MNIT Sports Tournament) in 2007. It is an All-India Invitational Sports Meet and is one of Rajasthan’s Best Sports Tournament. This event, so far has been receiving an overwhelming response of over 700 participants from premier institutions of the nation such as IITs, BITS Pilani, NITs, DCE, etc.</p>
<p>
The event aims to promote and develop sports culture in our institute. MNIT envisions conducting a healthy interaction and fair competition among the students of all the invited institutes.This event has been remarkable in creating a convivial environment among the participants and it strives to enhance the skills among the competitors. The soul of the event lies in its friendly atmosphere where students of different colleges join forces to celebrate the grandeur of the event.</p>
<p>
MST'14 has by far been one of the most glorious pages in the history of MNIT.With a total participation of 35 teams constituting more than 1000 students, MST’14 received a footfall of not less than 10000 students. This stands for maximum participation and footfall in any Intercollege Fest of MNIT till date.</p>
<p>
With unification of more than 40 colleges with over 1000 participants, MST'16 is now ready to triumph as never before.After completing 7 spectacular editions, MST now enters its 8th session being organized from 19th to 21st of February.</p>
