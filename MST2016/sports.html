						<p> Athletes in the sport are divided in six weight classes and placing is based on the total weight lifted on the three main lifts:
•	Squat</br>
•	Bench Press</br>
•	Deadlift</br>
•	Six bodyweight categories: up to 59kg, 66kg, 74kg, 83kg, 93kg, +105kg.</br>
•	Each competitor is allowed three attempts on each lift. The lifter’s best valid attempt on each lift counts toward his competition total.
</br>•	 Three referees judge the lift.</br>
•	If two or more lifters achieve the same total, the lighter lifter ranks above the heavier lifter.</br>
•	A good lift is signalled by indicating a white flag, and an illegal one by a red flag.</br>
•	Once the highest value has been collected for each lift, the total weight lifted in squat bench press and deadlift added up . The lifter with the highest combined weight lifter becomes the champion.
</br>•	In the case of a tie, then the lifter whose body weight is less becomes the champion.</br>
•	The weight of an athlete’s first lift determines their place in the starting order. If they choose to go for a light weight, they will go earlier in the order.
</br>•	Referee‘s decision will be last decision.</br>
•	Weighing of players will be started before 2 hour from competition .</br>
•	During the weighing player must mention his first lift for squat , bench press and deadlift to referee .</br>
•	Player must come with proper kit during competition .</br>
•	A player can participate in only one category .</br>
•	In case of any controversy during competition and weighing judge’s decision will consider as final decision.</br>

						<p><strong>Best of 5:</strong></p></br>
						<p>1ST SINGLES; 2ND SINGLES; DOUBLES</p></br>
						<p><strong>Scoring :</strong></p>
						<p>A match is played best 3 of 5 games (or 4/7 or 5/9). For each game, the first player to reach 11 points wins that game, however a game must be won by at least a two point margin.
</br>
A point is scored after each ball is put into play (not just when the server wins the point as in volleyball).
</br>
The edges of the table are part of the legal table surface, but not the sides.</br>
</p>
<p><strong> Flow of the Match:</strong></p>
<p>Each player serves two points in a row and then switch server. However, if a score of 10-10 is reached in any game, then each server serves only one point and then the server is switched. After each game, the players switch side of the table. In the final game (ie 5th game), the players switch side again after either player reaches 5 points.</p></br>
<p><strong>Legal Service:</strong></p>
</br><p>The ball must rest on an open hand palm. Then it must be tossed up at least 6 inches and struck so the ball first bounces on the server's side and then the opponent's side.</br>
If the serve is legal except that it touches the net, it is called a let serve. Let serves are not scored and are reserved.</p></br>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong></p>
<p>The paddle should have a red and a black side. The ball should be either orange or white and 40 mm in size. The table should be 2.74 meters long, 1.525 m wide, and 0.76 m high. </p></br>

next point. </br>
If that same player/team also wins the next point, that player/team
wins the “Game”; if the opposing player/team wins the next point, the score is
again “Deuce”.</br>

4)The player whose turn it is to serve shall serve the first point of the tie-break
game. </br>

doubles, the player of the opposing team due to serve next). </br>
<p><strong>SCORE IN A SET</strong></br></p>
<p>
 The two main methods are the

			<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cricket Rules</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Player Rules</strong>
	<br/></p>
	<p>
1)Cricket is a game played between two teams made up of eleven players each. <br/>
2)There is also a reserve player called a "twelfth man" who is used should a player be injured during play.<br/>
3)The twelfth man is not allowed to bowl, bat, wicket keep or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as a
substitute fielder. <br/>
4)The original player is free to return to the game as soon as they have recovered from
their injury.<br/>
5)Two umpires are in place on the playing field while there is also a third umpire off the field who is in
charge of video decisions.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Game Structure</strong>
<br/></p>
<p>
1)Before the game begins an official will toss a coin. The captain who guesses the correct side of the coin
will then choose if they want to bat or field first.<br/>
2) One team will then bat while the other will bowl & field. <br/>
3)The aim of the batting team is to score runs while the aim of the fielding team is to bowl ten
people out and close the batting teams' innings.<br/>
4)Batting is done in pairs.<br/>
5)Once the first team has been bowled out the second team would then go into bat.<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Ways to score runs</strong><br/></p>
<p>
1)The aim of the batsmen is to score runs.<br/>
2) One of the main cricket rules is that for batsment to score runs they must run to each other's end of the pitch (from one end to the other).<br/>
3) As well as running they can also scoreruns by hitting boundaries. A boundary scores the batsmen either 4 or 6 runs. <br/>
<p>Extras</p><p>
a)A "No Ball" can be declared for many reasons: If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong
place, the ball is declared dangerous.<br/>
b)A "Wide Ball" will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable
opportunity to score off the delivery.<br/>
c)A "Bye" is where a ball that the runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.<br/>
d)A "Leg Bye" is where runs are scored by hitting the batsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a
no ball or wide.<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Ways Batsmen can get out</strong><br/></p>

<p>
1)Bowled - Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman's wickets the
batsman is given out.<br/>
2)Caught - Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits the ball or touches the ball at all with his bat or
hand/glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. <br/>
3)Leg Before Wicket (LBW) - If the ball is bowled and it hits the batsman first without the bat
hitting it then an LBW decision is possible.<br/>
4)Stumped - A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts
down his wicket while he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run
it would be a runout).<br/>
5)Run Out - Cricket rules state that a batsman is out if no part of his bat or body is grounded
behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the
fielding side.<br/>

2) A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder.<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Winning The Game</strong><br/></p>
<p>
1)To win you have to score more goals than that of your opponents.<br/>
2) If the scores are level after 90 minutes then the game will end as a draw apart from in cup games where the game can go to extra time and even a penalty shootout to decide the winner.<br/>
3) Players must use their feet to kick the ball and are prohibited to use their hands apart from goalkeepers who can use any part of their body within the 18 yard box (of which more can be found out in the next section).<br/>

</p>
 <p><strong>Rules of Football</strong><br/></p>
<p>
1)A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period in between.<br/>
2)Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.<br/>
3)The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.<br/>
4)Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with each team being able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. <br/>
4)Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee’s (linesmen). It’s the job of the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and added on time at the end of each half. <br/>
5)The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding a decision. It’s the assistant referee’s job to spot offside’s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team.<br/>
6)If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then 30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.<br/>
7)If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.<br/>
8)For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the referee’s discretion. <br/>
9)The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.<br/>
10)If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.<br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Offside Rule</strong></p>
<p>
1)Offside can be called when an attacking player is in front of the last defender when the pass is played through to them. <br/>
2)The offside area is designed to discourage players from simply hanging around the opponent’s goal waiting for a pass. To be onside they must be placed behind the last defender when the ball is played to them. <br/>
3)If the player is in front of that last defender then he is deemed to be offside and free kick to the defending team will be called.
